              <p>
                Kurukshetra is an international techno-management fest holding a
                UNESCO patronage. It was named after the apocalyptic battle
                between Kauravas and Pandavas in an ancient Indian epic, the
                Mahabharata. All the five Pandavas have different powers and
                skills which led them to win the battle. So, the different
                qualities of people will make this a perfect battle. But here,
                the battle is more interesting because it takes place with
                brains instead of swords. Its logo, the Cyclotron, symbolizes
                the celebration of the indomitable spirit of engineering and
                innovation. That was the battle fought with immense physical
                powers to conquer the territory but this is the battle of
                cognitive skills to win the tech world from which the tagline
                ‘’The Battle of Brains‘’ was derived.
